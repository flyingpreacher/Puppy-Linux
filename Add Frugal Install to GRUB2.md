How to add Puppy Linux "Frugal" installation to the Grub2? 
Having a light-weight Linux distro like Puppy Linux is always handy to have on hard disk. Of course, you can keep it as a CD or USB and boot it as and when required. But, I prefer the traditional way - have it in HDD when there is no scarcity of space. First install Puppy after booting it from CD or USB. Installations are very easy to follow and self-explanatory. Choose the "Frugal" option if you want it to co-exist with your existing OSs. Once installation is done a text file with the grub2 update instructions will pop up. It is, however, not easy to follow. Copy and save it to a location which your primary linux distro can access. Then, reboot to your primary linux distro and type in the terminal $gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom For Ubuntu, add sudo. The initial lines would look like this: #!/bin/shexec tail -n +3 $0# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries. Simply type the# menu entries you want to add after this comment. Be careful not to change# the 'exec tail' line above. Add the following lines below it: menuentry "Puppy Linux 5.3.3 (frugal on sda5)" set root='(hd0,4)'search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 2C20-6100linux /slacko5.3.3frugal/vmlinuz pmedia=atahd psubdir=slacko5.3.3frugalinitrd /slacko5.3.3frugal/initrd.gz
Change the menuentry to your Puppy Linux version, anyway it is for your reference and doesn't matter what you write till you are aware what you are booting up.Set root option you'll get from the text file pop up you had saved earlier after frugal installation of Puppy. In search option, edit the uuid of the hard disk where you saved Puppy. You can get your all HDD uuid's by typing the following in the terminal: $ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ Next line would come from the text file again. Edit the folder name (here /slacko5.3.3frugal). For example, I installed Puppy Precise in sdb1 (with uuid 5ddaba1b-a977-4409-a78d-09f6993275a8) in root (hd1,0) folder /precise5.2.60frugal then my menuentry will be: menuentry "Puppy Linux 5.2.60 (frugal on sdb1)"  set root='(hd1,0)' search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 5ddaba1b-a977-4409-a78d-09f6993275a8 linux /precise5.2.60frugal/vmlinuz pmedia=atahd psubdir=precise5.2.60frugal initrd /precise5.2.60frugal/initrd.gz Finally, update grub! That's it. On rebooting, you'll get the Puppy boot option in the grub.
